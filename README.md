# Code description

Internship Task-4 focuses on performing advanced load testing of a web application using Gatling, a powerful open-source performance testing tool. The main purpose of this task is to evaluate how a web application behaves under different levels of user load and to analyze its performance when subjected to simulated heavy traffic. Load testing is a critical aspect of software quality assurance, as it helps identify performance bottlenecks, scalability issues, and system limitations before an application is deployed into a real-world environment.In this task, Gatling is used to simulate multiple virtual users accessing the web application concurrently. These virtual users perform predefined actions such as sending HTTP requests, navigating through web pages, submitting forms, or accessing APIs. By gradually increasing the number of users and request frequency, the system is tested under normal, peak, and stress conditions. This approach helps in understanding how the application responds to increased demand and whether it can maintain acceptable performance levels.The Gatling framework uses Scala-based scripts to define test scenarios. These scripts specify user behavior, request sequences, pauses, and load injection profiles. The task involves configuring scenarios that reflect real-world usage patterns, such as ramp-up of users, constant load, and sudden spikes in traffic. Advanced load testing techniques are applied to closely mimic actual user behavior and system usage. During test execution, Gatling collects detailed performance metrics, including response time, throughput, request success and failure rates, and latency distribution. These metrics provide valuable insights into the system’s performance characteristics. For example, response time analysis helps determine whether the application meets performance requirements, while error rates reveal stability issues under heavy load.The deliverable for this task is a detailed performance report. This report includes an overview of the test environment, test scenarios, load configuration, and execution results. It also contains graphical representations generated by Gatling, such as response time charts, requests per second, and user activity over time. Based on the results, observations and conclusions are drawn regarding system scalability, reliability, and performance limits.Additionally, the task emphasizes analyzing results to identify performance bottlenecks, such as slow database queries, inefficient server resources, or network delays. Recommendations for performance improvement may also be included, making the report more valuable from a real-world testing perspective. Overall, Internship Task-4 provides hands-on experience in performance and load testing using Gatling. It enhances understanding of how web applications behave under heavy load, improves skills in performance analysis, and highlights the importance of proactive testing in delivering reliable and scalable software systems.
